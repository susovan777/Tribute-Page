                <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
                <p><B>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</B> (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
                    scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
                    as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                    Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
                    India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be
                    known as the 'Missile Man of India' for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                    vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
                    India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                    1974.[5]

                    Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
                    after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                    India's highest civilian honour.</p>
